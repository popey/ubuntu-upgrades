This is a simple work in progress test of Twine for creating a story to help users diagnose and fix problems with Ubuntu. 

//This story is unfinished and unsupported and assumes the visitor is using Unity on Ubuntu.//

The goal of this story is to debug &#x27;&#x27;upgrade&#x27;&#x27; issues. 

Choose a debugging path:-
* [[Upgrade was started but is hanging]]
* [[Upgrade completed, but system is malfunctioning]]
* [[System failed during upgrade or power lost]] 
* [[Upgrade Crashed]] 
* [[Upgrade finished successfully]]
Alternative options:-
* [[Wipe everything and re-install]]
* [[Wipe system data but keep personal data]]
* [[Restore from backup]]
Background information:-
* [[What is an Ubuntu Upgrade]]
* [[Thinking about upgrading]]
* [[About to start the upgrade]]

There are also [[Useful Tools]] and [[Common Fixes]] available throughout the story.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="About to start the upgrade" tags="" position="1261,275">These pages are for problems before the upgrade has begun. If the upgrade has already started or the upgrade is complete, go back to the [[Start]].

At this point we assume the system is functioning correctly before beginning any kind of upgrade. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that a good [[Backup]] is worth taking before upgrading begins.

Firstly, identify [[What version of Ubuntu am I running?]] then return here.

There&#x27;s no guarantee these will fix any particular issue, but experience has shown they resolve many problems.

* [[Re-install Ubuntu Desktop Package]]
* [[Configure Unconfigured Packages]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Upgrade Crashed" tags="" position="208,631">If the upgrade process itself crashes, it usually leaves a log behind which can help identify why.

There&#x27;s one master &#x27;meta package&#x27; which, if removed, can cause other packages to be missing. Typically re-installing this meta-package can fix issues by installing the missing packages.

However there&#x27;s confusingly a &#x27;task&#x27; of the same name, which also can be re-installed and has a similar (if more potent) result.

Reinstall the metapackage:-

* [[Switch to Console]] if your graphical display is broken, or [[Open Terminal on Desktop]] if you have access to the graphical display
* Run the following command:-

sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop

//At this point enter the user password//

Typical output:-

{{{alan@deep-thought ~&gt; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop}}}
{{{[sudo] password for alan:}}}
{{{Reading package lists... Done}}}
{{{Building dependency tree}}}
{{{Reading state information... Done}}}
{{{ubuntu-desktop is already the newest version.}}}
{{{Use &#x27;apt-get autoremove&#x27; to remove them.}}}

* Run the following command:-

//Note the circumflex &quot;^&quot; at the end of the line. This is important and indicates installation of a task//

&#x27;&#x27;This section is worth noting. It indicates something was missing and is now going to be installed. Many packages listed here indicates that the task was missing for a while, or perhaps an upgrade fell over part way through. Packages to be removed may also be indicative of a broken upgrade, or may simply be old packages that haven&#x27;t been cleared up for a while.&#x27;&#x27;

To finish configuring any packages that are in that state, use the following command:-

(font: &quot;Courier New&quot;)[sudo dpkg --configure -a]

Do this after [[Open Terminal on Desktop]] or [[Switch to Console]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Open Terminal on Desktop" tags="" position="1411,971">The terminal is a powerful text based interface to the computer. Use it to issue commands, edit files and read logs.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="What version of Ubuntu am I running?" tags="" position="1733,445">It&#x27;s often important to know exactly what version of Ubuntu is running. 

To find out what version of Ubuntu is running, either on the console or in a terminal, type the following:-

{{{lsb_release -a}}}

The output will be similar to the following:-

{{{No LSB modules are available.}}}
{{{Distributor ID:	Ubuntu}}}
{{{Description:	Ubuntu 14.10}}}
{{{Release:	14.10}}}
{{{Codename:	utopic}}}

The {{{Release}}} line is typically most useful, although some people use the {{{Codename}}} when referring to releases. The release number is simply the Month and Year of release in MM.YY format.

The [[Releases|https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases]] page on the Ubuntu Wiki lists which releases are currently supported, and which are EOL (End Of Life) or in active development.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="What version of Linux Kernel am I running?" tags="" position="1735,598">It&#x27;s often important to know exactly what version and architecture of the Linux Kernel you&#x27;re running. 

To find out what version of Linux Kernel you&#x27;re running, either on the console or in a terminal, type the following:-

&lt;p&gt;uname -a&lt;/p&gt;

You will see output similar to the following:-

&lt;p&gt;Linux deep-thought &lt;b&gt;3.16.0-23-generic&lt;/b&gt; #30-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 16 13:17:16 UTC 2014 &lt;b&gt;x86_64&lt;/b&gt; x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux&lt;/p&gt;

The Linux Kernel version number is highlighted above. In this example it&#x27;s 3.16.0-23-generic.

The architecture is also highlighted which is x86_64. The following table details some of the common terms used for the architecture.

* x86_64 - 64-bit, AMD64
* i686 - 32-bit, i386 (incorrectly)

Pastebins are websites which freely host those files temporarily for easy sharing with others.

Essentially to share a file you can upload it via one of the following means, and give the expert the url which gets displayed.

For each of these examples replace &lt;filename&gt; with the actual filename the expert is requesting. This may include the full path such as &#x27;/var/log/Xorg.0.log&#x27;, or it could be a file in your current directory such as &#x27;.xsession-errors&#x27;

* Pastebin an entire file (omit the &lt; and &gt;)

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Thinking about upgrading" tags="" position="1345,415">Most Ubuntu users stick to LTS (Long Term Support releases) which generally come out every 2 years in April. Interim (non-LTS) releases are supported with bug fixes and security updates for a shorter time. Some users need to upgrade to a new release to continue to receive support.

Firstly, find out [[What version of Ubuntu am I running?]] then come back here.

Find out more about what releases are currently supported at &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some recommended upgrade paths:-

* 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) to 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)
* 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) to 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)
* 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) to 15.04 (Vivid Vervet)
* 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) to 15.10 (Wily Werewolf)

Examples of not recommended upgrade paths:-

* 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) to 15.10 (Wily Warewolf) - 15.10 is not yet released, but in development
* 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) to 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) - Skipping 14.10

Each has a code name and a version number based on the year and month of release. 

A release is either an LTS (Long Term Support) or not. LTS releases are released every 2 years in April and are supported with bug fixes and security updates for 5 years. Non-LTS releases are supported with bug fixes and security updates for 9 months.

An Ubuntu Upgrade is when the system is updated from one release to another. Each software package on the system is updated from the version in the current release to (typically) a newer version in the next release. Not all software changes significantly between one 6-monthly release and the next, and some don&#x27;t change at all. However there&#x27;s usually a significant change in software versions from one LTS release to another - as there was a 2-year gap between their releases.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Boot into Recovery Mode" tags="" position="1743,735">Recovery mode is a special way of booting up Ubuntu providing expert tools, but not the standard desktop. This can be used to diagnose, debug and fix issues.

Steps to enter recovery mode:-
* Reboot computer
* Hold down SHIFT to interrupt booting immediately after the Power On Self Test or any manufacturer splash screen / logos

//Note: Sometimes the computer continues booting normally. In this case, reboot and try again, and hold down SHIFT earlier in the boot process.//

* At the menu, use the down arrow key to highlight &#x27;Advanced Options&#x27;, press ENTER
* Use the down arrow to select uppermost line with &#x27;(recovery)&#x27; appended, press ENTER
